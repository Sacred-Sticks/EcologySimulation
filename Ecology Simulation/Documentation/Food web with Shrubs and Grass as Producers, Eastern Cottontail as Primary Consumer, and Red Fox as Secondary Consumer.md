## Description of Organisms
- Shrubs and Grass: these plants are pruducers, as the produce their own food through photosynthesis. They will likely be everywhere where there is soil and sunlight.
- Trees: These plants are also producers. Their high leaves will shade large areas, limiting the populations of other organisms that rely on photosynthesis. They pruduce seeds and/or fruits that can feed herbivores. We may choose to implement this as a feature of the simulation, or just leave it implied.
- [Eastern Cottontail](https://animalia.bio/eastern-cottontail#description): A small, solitary herbivore that eats all kinds of plants. They usually have a length of 36 - 48 centimeters. Eastern cottontails usually move only short distances, and they may remain sitting very still for up to 15 minutes at a time. When chased, they run in a zigzag pattern, reaching up to 18 mph (29 km/h).
- [Red Fox](https://animalia.bio/red-fox#distribution): Red Foxes are omnivores and scevengers that eat a highly varied diet, but the mostly feed on small rodents and that is what we are going to simulate. They live in small family groups that share a joint territory. They are commonly 45 - 90 centimeters long and have a top speed of 50 km/h
